# sleep_state_time_series_analysis

# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources developed for the "Detecting Sleep Onset and Wake" competition hosted by the Child Mind Institute (CMI) in collaboration with the Healthy Brain Network. The goal of this competition is to develop a model trained on wrist-worn accelerometer data to accurately determine a person's sleep state, specifically detecting sleep onset and wake.

We aim to contribute to the advancement of sleep research and its impact on various aspects of health, especially in children and youth with mood and behavior difficulties. Sleep plays a crucial role in regulating mood, emotions, and behavior, and improving our ability to analyze accelerometer data can lead to better insights into sleep patterns.

# Background
Importance of Sleep: Sleep is vital for overall health and cognitive functioning. Research in this area has been challenging due to the lack of naturalistic data capture and accurate annotation.

Current Annotation Methods: Current approaches for annotating sleep data, such as sleep logs and heuristic-based software, have limitations in terms of reliability and accuracy.

The Child Mind Institute (CMI): CMI is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of children and families struggling with mental health and learning disorders. They aim to improve children's mental health by providing evidence-based care and resources.

# Data Source
The data used for this competition is provided by the Healthy Brain Network, a significant mental health study based in New York City.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this competition are as follows:

Develop a model for accurately detecting sleep onset and wake from wrist-worn accelerometer data.
Contribute to improving the understanding of the relationship between sleep and mood/behavioral difficulties, especially in children.
Enable large-scale sleep studies by providing more reliable and automated tools for sleep monitoring.
